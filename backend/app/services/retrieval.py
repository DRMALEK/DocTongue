"""Retrieval and grounded citation orchestration.

This module owns the runtime flow for answering a user question:

1. Retrieve top vector hits for the question.
2. Filter weak hits with lightweight grounding checks.
3. Ask the answer generator to answer from filtered excerpts.
4. Bind answer markers like [1], [2] back to retrieved hits.
5. Normalize markers at the document level so multiple chunk markers
    from the same document collapse to one citation number.

The returned ChatResponse includes the final answer text and the
document excerpts used as citations.
